In this task, I've created and configured a user account. The user account will store user data such as name, department,
location, and contact information. I will then invite an external user 

Below, I've listed the steps that I took to complete this task:

      Account enabled = checked
      Job title (Properties tab) = IT Lab Administrator
      Department (Properties tab) = IT

  5. Once complete, I selected Review + Create and then Create.

  6. I refreshed the page then my new user was created!!!!
