Below, I've listed the steps that I took to complete this task:

  1. In the Azure portal, I searched for and selected Groups

  3. In the All Groups Blade, I selected New group and create a new group

  4. Once in <b>create a new group</b>, I filled out the following credentials.

      Group type = Security
      Group name = IT Lab Administrators
      Group description = Administrators that manage the IT lab
      Membership type = Assigned

  5. Select No owners selected.

In the Add owners page, search for and select yourself as the owner. Notice you can have more than one owner.

Select No members selected.

In the Add members pane, search for and select the az104-user1 and the guest user you invited. Add both of the users to the group.

Select Create to deploy the group.

Refresh the page and ensure your group was created.

Select the new group and review the Members and Owners information.
