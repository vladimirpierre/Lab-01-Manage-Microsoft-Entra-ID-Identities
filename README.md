Lab 1: Manage Microsoft Entra ID Identities from CLI

This is the first part of a series of labs for Microsoft Azure Administrators. In this lab, I will create/manage users and groups. Users and groups are the basic building blocks for an identity solution.

Lab scenario

In this lab scenario, an organization is building a new lab environment for pre-production testing of apps and services. A few engineers, including the virtual machines, are being hired to manage the lab environment. You have been tasked with provisioning users and groups to allow the engineers to authenticate using Microsoft Entra ID. To minimize administrative overhead, membership of the groups should be updated automatically based on job titles.


Skills Demonstrated 

Task 1: Create and configure user accounts.
Task 2: Create groups and add members.
